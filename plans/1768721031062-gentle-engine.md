# Plan: Address "Read" Tool Absolute Path Requirement

## Understanding the Issue
The user encountered `ENOENT` errors because the `read` tool was called with relative paths (`src/components/...`). The `read` tool in this environment (`OpenCode`/`Antigravity`) strictly requires **absolute paths**. When a relative path is provided, it resolves relative to the agent's internal execution directory (`C:\Users\dbenn\AppData\Local\OpenCode\...`) rather than the project directory (`D:\dazeb\Documents\github\basaltstack-project\bedrock`), leading to file not found errors.

The user asked if we can "change the read tool" to prevent this.

## findings
1.  **Tool Nature**: The `read` tool is a system-level function provided by the OpenCode environment (likely via an MCP server like `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`).
2.  **Configuration**: While `.opencode/opencode.json` and `.mcp.json` exist, they control permissions and server arguments, not the internal logic of the tool itself (e.g., how it resolves paths).
3.  **Conclusion**: We cannot modify the source code of the `read` tool to automatically handle relative paths because it is an immutable part of the provided environment.

## Proposed Solution
Since we cannot change the tool, we must change the **agent's behavior**.

### Strategy: Strict Absolute Path Usage
I (the agent) must strictly adhere to the following protocol:
1.  **Identify Project Root**: Always be aware of the current working directory (`D:\dazeb\Documents\github\basaltstack-project\bedrock`).
2.  **Resolve Paths**: Before calling `read` (or `write`/`edit`), I must explicitly concatenate the project root with the relative path.
    *   *Incorrect*: `read(filePath="src/app/page.tsx")`
    *   *Correct*: `read(filePath="D:\dazeb\Documents\github\basaltstack-project\bedrock\src\app\page.tsx")`

### Actionable Steps for the User
1.  **Explanation**: Inform the user that the tool itself cannot be modified as it's a system component.
2.  **Commitment**: Assurance that I will handle path resolution internally from now on.
3.  **No Code Changes Required**: This fix is behavioral, not a code change in the repository.

## Verification
*   **Test**: Run a `read` command using an absolute path on a file we know exists (e.g., `package.json`).
*   **Success Criteria**: The content is returned without `ENOENT`.
