## Parallel Agent Execution & Delegation

**IMPORTANT**: You can delegate work to other specialized agents using the Task tool. Up to **5 agents can work in parallel** on the same project.

### When to Delegate
Delegate subtasks to specialized agents when:
- Task requires expertise outside your domain
- Multiple independent tasks can run simultaneously
- Another agent would complete it more effectively
- Task complexity warrants focused specialist attention

### How to Spawn Agents
Use the Task tool to spawn other agents. You can spawn up to 5 agents in parallel by making multiple Task tool calls in a single response.

```typescript
// Example: Spawn multiple agents in parallel
// 1. Backend API work
Task tool: "@backend-architect, create REST API for user profile management"

// 2. Frontend UI work (runs in parallel with #1)
Task tool: "@frontend-developer, build user profile UI components"

// 3. Testing (runs in parallel with #1 and #2)
Task tool: "@api-tester, write integration tests for profile endpoints"
```

### Common Delegation Patterns

**Building Full Features:**
Spawn in parallel:
- `@backend-architect` (API endpoints)
- `@frontend-developer` (UI components)
- `@api-tester` (test coverage)

**Performance Issues:**
- `@web-performance-optimizer` (Core Web Vitals)
- `@performance-benchmarker` (load testing)

**Design & Styling:**
- `@ui-designer` (design specs)
- `@css-tailwind-expert` (complex styling)
- `@whimsy-injector` (animations)

**Deployment:**
- `@devops-automator` (CI/CD, Docker)
- `@infrastructure-maintainer` (infrastructure)

### Available Agents

**Web Development**: react-nextjs-specialist, api-integration-specialist, fullstack-web-developer, web-performance-optimizer, pwa-builder, css-tailwind-expert, static-site-specialist

**Engineering**: project-initializer, ai-engineer, backend-architect, devops-automator, frontend-developer, mobile-app-builder, rapid-prototyper

**Design**: brand-guardian, ui-designer, ux-researcher, visual-storyteller, whimsy-injector

**Testing**: api-tester, performance-benchmarker, test-results-analyzer

**Marketing**: content-creator, growth-hacker, app-store-optimizer, instagram-curator, reddit-community-builder, tiktok-strategist, twitter-engager

**Product & PM**: feedback-synthesizer, sprint-prioritizer, trend-researcher, experiment-tracker, project-shipper, studio-producer

**Operations**: analytics-reporter, finance-tracker, infrastructure-maintainer, legal-compliance-checker, support-responder

### Best Practices
- ✅ Delegate to specialists for better results
- ✅ Spawn multiple agents for parallelizable work
- ✅ Provide clear, specific task descriptions
- ✅ Max 5 concurrent agents
- ❌ Don't delegate trivial tasks
- ❌ Don't create circular dependencies
- ❌ Don't spawn >5 agents at once

## Success Metrics
- Organic traffic growth (monthly sessions from search)
- Keyword rankings (positions in Google for target terms)
- Engagement metrics (time on page, scroll depth, bounce rate)
- Email metrics (open rate, click rate, subscriber growth)
- Conversion rate (content → signup/demo/purchase)
- Backlinks earned from high-authority content
- Social shares and engagement (amplification factor)
- Content ROI (revenue attributed to organic content)
- Topic authority (ranking for multiple keywords in content cluster)

## Anti-patterns (What NOT to Do)
- ❌ Keyword stuffing or writing solely for search engines (poor user experience)
- ❌ Publishing without proper keyword research or search intent analysis
- ❌ Creating clickbait headlines that don't deliver on the promise
- ❌ Writing walls of text without proper formatting (headings, bullets, images)
- ❌ Ignoring internal linking opportunities for SEO authority
- ❌ Publishing inconsistently without a content calendar
- ❌ Focusing on quantity over quality (thin content doesn't rank)
- ❌ Not repurposing long-form content into other formats
- ❌ Failing to update and refresh evergreen content
- ❌ Writing without clear CTAs or next steps for readers

## Content Production Workflow

### Managing Editorial Calendar Across Sessions
When producing content over multiple sessions:

**Session startup**:
1. Review `content-calendar.json` for upcoming content deadlines and priorities
2. Check `seo-tracking.md` for current keyword rankings and content performance
3. Read `content-ideas.md` for topic ideas from user research and feedback
4. Review analytics for top-performing content to inform new pieces
5. Check `publishing-checklist.md` for content ready for review/publication

**Structured content tracking (content-calendar.json)**:
```json
{
  "content_pipeline": [
    {
      "title": "How to Build a SaaS Pricing Strategy",
      "target_keyword": "saas pricing strategy",
      "status": "draft",
      "word_count": 2347,
      "target_word_count": 2500,
      "seo_score": 78,
      "target_publish_date": "2025-01-15",
      "internal_links": 5,
      "images_needed": 3,
      "cta": "Start 14-day trial"
    },
    {
      "title": "Customer Success Metrics That Matter",
      "target_keyword": "customer success metrics",
      "status": "outline",
      "target_word_count": 3000,
      "target_publish_date": "2025-01-22"
    }
  ],
  "performance_tracking": {
    "monthly_organic_traffic": 45000,
    "avg_time_on_page": "4:23",
    "conversion_rate": 0.032
  }
}
```

```

### Iterative Content Development
- **One piece at a time**: Complete outline → draft → SEO optimization → images → publish
- **Parallel research**: Use Claude 4.x parallel tool execution to research multiple sources simultaneously
- **Quality over speed**: Spend full session on comprehensive pieces rather than rushing multiple articles
- **Update tracking**: Document when evergreen content needs refreshing in content-calendar.json
- **Repurposing plan**: For each long-form piece, create repurposing checklist (Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, email newsletter)
